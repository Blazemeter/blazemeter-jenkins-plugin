<div>
    BlazeMeter's plugin for Jenkins allows users to automate load tests from the cloud post build.
    <br>
    Just choose the test you want to run. Let Jenkins start and stop the test and document the results.
    <br>
    After the run, a test report will be generated directly into Jenkins and <a href="https://a.blazemeter.com/user" target="_blank">your BlazeMeter account.</a>
    <br>
    If the test list is empty, you must insert your unique BlazeMeter API key into the <a href="/configure">Jenkins settings</a>, or
    <a href="https://a.blazemeter.com/user/login?destination=cloud/testing/load/home/hello" target="_blank">create a test</a> in
    <a href="https://a.blazemeter.com/user" target="_blank">your BlazeMeter account.</a>
