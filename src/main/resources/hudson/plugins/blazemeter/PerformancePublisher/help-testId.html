    BlazeMeter's plugin for Jenkins allows users to automate load tests from the cloud post build.
    Just choose the test you want to run. Let Jenkins start and stop the test and document the results.
    After the run, a test report will be generated directly into Jenkins and <a href="https://a.blazemeter.com/user" target="_blank">your BlazeMeter account.</a>
